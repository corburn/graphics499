/*
 *The final purpose for me to find stochastic sampling algorithm
 *In this function, I will try to let the width and height to be half
 *of the original width and original height.
 *For example, if the original width is W and origianl height is H
 *Now, by we using downSampling the width is W/2, and the height is
 *H/2. No matter the width and height at here is odd or vevn

/*
 *If I can use 1D Arrry, I don't use 2D Array
 *Because the continue data is stored by linear
 *If I can use pointer, I don't use Array
 *Compare by using Array, using pointer is more efficiency
